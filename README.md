DistriRAG Framework – Distributed, Agnostic, and Deterministic RAG Architecture
1. Executive Summary

DistriRAG is a high-performance RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) ecosystem designed for enterprise-grade scalability and strict data privacy. By decoupling the ingestion, vector indexing, and inference layers, it provides a unique "Hybrid-Edge" approach where data stays secure and compute remains flexible.
2. Technical Architecture & Stack
    Orchestration Layer (The Brain): n8n manages the complex logic flow, acting as a stateless API Gateway and infrastructure controller.
    Data Consistency Layer: Postgres 16 manages relational metadata and system state, ensuring 1:1 synchronization with the vector store.
    Vector Engine: Qdrant provides high-speed HNSW indexing for semantic retrieval.
    Service Layer: FastAPI (Python) handles heavy lifting like PDF coordinate extraction, embedding generation, and semantic reranking.
    Application Layer: NestJS provides a robust backend for user management and system configuration.
    Presentation Layer: Angular offers a specialized UI featuring "Point-and-Click" source verification.

3. Key Innovation: Deterministic Source Traceability

Most RAG systems suffer from "hallucinated references." DistriRAG solves this by:
    Extracting exact bounding box coordinates during PDF ingestion.
    Mapping unique Chunk-UUIDs across Postgres and Qdrant.
    Allowing the user to click an AI-generated citation and instantly open the source document at the exact page and paragraph.

4. Hybrid-Edge Operations (SSH Orchestration)

Through a custom SSH2-based node in n8n, the system can:
    Provision and manage remote inference engines (Ollama/vLLM) on edge GPU nodes.
    Separate the sensitive data layer from the high-compute inference layer.
    Switch dynamically between Cloud providers (Google Vertex AI, OpenAI) and local hardware based on cost or privacy requirements.

5. Deployment Strategy

The entire stack is containerized using Docker Compose, supporting multi-node deployment. Each microservice is independently scalable, allowing for high-availability configurations in production environments.
